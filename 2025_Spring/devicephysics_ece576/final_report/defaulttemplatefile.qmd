abstract: |
  The MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) is a critical component of modern technology. At lab-scale, its fabrication demonstrates the principles of semiconductor processing and offers perspective to the impressive automation and technological achievements found in a modern semiconductor fab.  

  In this lab, we fabricated an n-type MOSFET, starting with a silicon wafer  and applying a rigorous process including photolithography, oxide removal and growth, diffusion, electron beam evaporation and metal deposition, and lift-off. The reasoning and details of the fabrication procedure are presented, along with an introduction to the technology and discussions of the physics underlying device operation, the reasoning behind fabrication steps, and models available to understand processes. Where possible, images of lab equipment and the device are provided, and although no quantitative data were collected during this experiment, synthetic data and plots are presented to illustrate the principles of fabrication processes.

  Overall, n-MOSFET devices are suggested by imagery to have been successfully produced, and valuable exposure to and knowledge of device fabrication were gained.

file is intended to serve as a "sample article file"
for IEEE journal papers produced with (Pandoc/Quarto)-Markdown using `IEEEtran.cls` version 1.8b and later for the PDF output. 
It is based on `bare_jrnl_new_sample4.tex` provided by IEEE Publication Technology, Staff and available from  <https://template-selector.ieee.org/>.
The most common elements are covered in the simplified and updated instructions in `New_IEEEtran_how-to.pdf`.
For less common elements you can refer back to the original `IEEEtran_HOWTO.pdf`. 
It is assumed that the reader has a basic working knowledge of {{< latex >}} @mittelbach2023latex and of (Pandoc/Quarto)-Markdown [@MacFarlane_Pandoc; @Allaire_Quarto_2022] markup.


# The Design, Intent, and Limitations of this Templates

The `quarto-ieee` template is intended to **approximate the final look and page length of the articles/papers** either in PDF output or HTML output. 
**They are NOT intended to be the final produced work that is displayed in print or on IEEEXplore^®^**.
They will help to give the authors an approximation of the number of pages and layout that will be in the final version. 

## Unsuported feature and limitations
Although most of the {{< latex >}} and `IEEEtran.cls` commands and environment are supported, 
there are some limitations when trying to export to a format other than PDF  (e.g. HTML output).
For PDF output, the reader can use the {{< latex >}} command directly. However, this may break other output formats.
\
It can be can reported the following limitations of the  `quarto-ieee` template:
- Several authors with same affiliation produce weird output. 
  In such case, it is recommended to use `note` and `tex-author-no-affiliation: true`.
- For `PDF` output
  - `quarto-ieee` use a hack to handle the `longtable` issue with  2-column {{< latex >}} documents[^issues-1023].
    But, in some cases, a page overflow may occur (see also @sec-tables).
- For `HTML` output
  - The default Quarto toc is used, so the table of contents (toc) display is not the same as on [IEEEXplore<sup>®</sup>].
  - Footnote are put at the end of document, while on [IEEEXplore<sup>®</sup>] there are placed in the accordion.
  - Figures are not placed in the accordion.
  - [IEEEXplore<sup>®</sup>] specifics (e.g. citation metrics, etc.)
  - The `HTML` output is a  Quarto citeable article @quarto-citation, so a citation appendix is automatically added to the article end.

# Front matter

Most Quarto's authors and affiliations schemes  @quarto-funding are supported in the YAML front matter to render authors as requested by IEEE journals in PDF and HTML outputs.
When provided to an author, the `note` entry is rendered as a `\thanks{}` in `PDF` output (ignored in `HTML` output).
Additionally, the reader may add to an author a `photo: path/to/photograph.png` with a `bio` metadata entries to generate a `IEEEbiography`, while a sole `bio` generates a `IEEEbiographynophoto` (these features is used both in `PDF` and `HTML` outputs).
\
The `funding` entry is also used in both PDF and HTML outputs @quarto-funding.
At version v1.1.1, only the `funding.statement` is used.
Similarly, `citation` entry is supported to make the HTML output a "_citeable article_" @quarto-citation.

 
# Some Common Elements
## Sections and Subsections
As stated in the `IEEEtran` template enumeration of section headings is desirable, but not required.
When numbered, it should be consistent throughout the article, that is, all headings and all levels of section headings in the article should be enumerated. 
Primary headings are designated with Roman numerals, secondary with capital letters, tertiary with Arabic numbers; and quaternary with lowercase letters. 
References and Acknowledgment headings are unlike all other section headings in text. 
They are never enumerated. 
They are simply primary headings without labels, regardless of whether the other headings in the article are enumerated. 

The following @sec-Markdown shows some basic usage and capabilities of `quarto-ieee`.

## Markdown basics {#sec-Markdown}
The reader can easily find many documentations on how to write using the (Pandoc/Quarto) Markdown syntax.
The `quarto-ieee` template relies mainly on the Markdown markup supported by Quarto @quarto-markdown, which is build based on Pandoc [@MacFarlane_Pandoc; @Allaire_Quarto_2022].
Below are some basic examples of usage of the Markdown markup (to save space, it is better to consult the original Quarto document `template.qmd`).


### Display equations
To write equations use `$` delimiters for inline formula or `$$` for block one.
To number the equations, it is recommended to use classic equation environments 
provided by {{< latex >}} and to use `\eqref{}` (or `\ref{}`) for cross-referencing.
For example:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
{{\chi}_a}=\text{diag}\left(\frac{{\chi}}{1+n_a{\chi}},\frac{{\chi}}{1+n_b{\chi}},\frac{{\chi}}{1+n_b{\chi}}\right),
\end{equation}
\begin{align}
a & = b + c \label{eq:2} \\
c & = d + e \label{eq:3}
\end{align}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:4}
\begin{cases}
    1&=n_a+2n_b \\
    n_a&=\dfrac{1-{\varepsilon}^2}{2{\varepsilon}^3}\left(\log\left(\dfrac{1+{\varepsilon}}{1-{\varepsilon}}\right)-2{\varepsilon}\right)
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The above equation is cross-referenced as \eqref{eq:1}, \eqref{eq:2}, \eqref{eq:3} and \eqref{eq:4}.

For now, avoid using the Quarto cross-references that use of `$$ $$` with `#eq-` label.
It works properly only for PDF output, but there are some issues with HTML[^issues-2275] output.


::: {.remark}
`quarto-ieee` template also supports the [`mhchem`](https://ctan.org/pkg/mhchem) (for chemical equation) 
and [`physics`](https://ctan.org/pkg/physics) (for flexible macros for typesetting equations) {{< latex >}} packages 
and [Mathjax extensions](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/extensions/index.html).
:::

### Theorems, Proofs and Remarks
To include a reference-able theorem, create a div with a `#thm-` label.
A theorem name is specified  via the first heading in the block. 
For example:

::: {#thm-line}

## Line

The equation of any straight line, called a linear equation, can be written as:

$$
y = mx + b
$$
:::

The theorem is cross-referenced as @thm-line.


There are a number of theorem variations supported by [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#theorems-and-proofs), each with their own label prefix:

- `#thm-` for Theorem;
- `#lem-` for Lemma;
- `#cor-` for Corollary
- `#prp-` for Proposition;
- `#cnj-` for Conjecture;
- `#def-` for Definition;
- `#exm-` for Example;
- `#exr-` for Exercise.


The `proof`, `remark` and `solution` environments generally receive similar typesetting as theorems.
However they are not numbered (and therefore cannot be cross-referenced). To create these environments just use them as the class name of a div such as:

::: {.solution name="The solution"}
An example of solution environment.
:::



### Figures
An image with nonempty alt text will be rendered as a figure with a caption with Pandoc and Quarto.
Quarto includes a different features to simplify the use of figures and subfigures.
Here, it is recommended to use div block with `#fig-` label to embed your Figures.


:::{#fig-1}
![](fig1.png){width="30%"}

An example of figure.
:::


:::{#fig-2  layout-ncol=2}
![ ](fig1.png){#fig-2a}

![ ](fig1.png){#fig-2b}

An example with sub-figure.
:::


The figures is cross-referenced as @fig-2  and even the sub-figures as @fig-2b.

### Tables {#sec-tables}

Similarly, many kind of tables may be used with Pandoc and Quarto.
The latter also includes different features to simplify the table output.
To make tables cross-referenceable use a label with a `#tbl-` prefix. 
\
However, it is recommended to avoid using the commonly used single Markdown table known as a 'pipe table'. 
In fact, Pandoc Markdown uses the {{< latex >}} `longtable` package, which does not support the two-column mode, which is required for most `IEEEtran` journals.
`quarto-ieee` uses a hack to temporarily switch to one-column mode. 
However, this hack may break the page layout.
To overcome this issue, a basic way is to use code cells (as for @tbl-other).
<!-- Quarto is a multi-language and it uses  `Knitr` to execute `R` code and can execute  Python code blocks within Markdown. -->

```{python}
#| label: tbl-panel
#| tbl-cap: "Main Caption"
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| tbl-subcap: 
#|   - "First Table"
#|   - "Second Table" 
#| tbl-id:
#|   - "tbl-first"
#|   - "tbl-second"

import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

# First table data
first_table = pd.DataFrame({
    'Col1': ['A', 'E', 'A'],
    'Col2': ['B', 'F', 'G'],
    'Col3': ['C', 'G', 'G']
})

# Second table data
second_table = pd.DataFrame({
    'Col1': ['A', 'E', 'A'],
    'Col2': ['B', 'F', 'G'],
    'Col3': ['C', 'G', 'G']
})

# Display tables
display(first_table)
display(second_table)
```

The Tables are cross-referenced as @tbl-panel for details, especially @tbl-second.
There is also @tbl-other.

## Bibliography

IEEE journal should normally use IEEEtran[^bibtex] {{< bibtex >}} style.
Nevertheless, Pandoc and Quarto do support {{< bibtex >}} with natbib or biblatex. However, neither is officially recommended for normal IEEE use.
For this reason, `quarto-ieee` uses `citeproc` with the `ieee` CSL style sheet.

[^bibtex]: IEEEtran BibTeX  style support  page is: <http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/ieeetran/bibtex/>
