  abstract = {The thermal-oxidation kinetics of silicon are examined in detail. Based on a simple model of oxidation which takes into account the reactions occurring at the two boundaries of the oxide layer as well as the diffusion process, the general relationship x02+Ax0=B(t+{$\tau$}) is derived. This relationship is shown to be in excellent agreement with oxidation data obtained over a wide range of temperature (700{$^\circ$}--1300{$^\circ$}C), partial pressure (0.1--1.0 atm) and oxide thickness (300--20 000 {\AA}) for both oxygen and water oxidants. The parameters A, B, and {$\tau$} are shown to be related to the physico-chemical constants of the oxidation reaction in the predicted manner. Such detailed analysis also leads to further information regarding the nature of the transported species as well as space-charge effects on the initial phase of oxidation.},

  year = {2000},
  publisher = {Gulf Professional Publishing},
  abstract = {Thanks to the continued exponential advances in semiconductor design and the demands of evolving and emerging application domains, the field of computer architecture has never been more dynamic. This, the first major book of computer architecture readings in over two decades, captures this dynamism and reveals Computer Architecture's rich history of practice. This is much more than a simple collection of papers. The editors have carefully selected the most influential primary sources in specific areas of inquiry that, taken together, present the critical issues of the entire discipline. These include issues in technology, implementation, economics, evaluation methods, instruction set design, instruction level parallelism, dataflow/multithreading, memory systems, input/output systems, single-instruction multiple data parallelism, and multiple-instruction multiple data parallelism. In addition, you'll find the editors' thoughtful, focused introductions to each area, providing the context and background necessary for understanding the significance and lasting impact of these papers. The primary sources and insightful commentary contained in this book provide foundational knowledge for computer architects as well as for those who design supporting system software and compilers. This is an excellent resource for practitioners, instructors, students, and researchers.   Includes more than 50 influential papers spanning four decades of computer architecture research and development Selected, edited, and introduced by three eminent researchers and educators in the field. Demonstrates the value of primary sources by showing how forgotten design ideas of the past are often rediscovered when new needs or constraints emerge.},

A recent model for impurity diffusion in semiconductors computes the flux in a different way by taking the spatial gradient of the product of the diffusion coefficient and the density of diffusing species. The results of these two approaches are different for spatially dependent diffusion coefficients. The nature and significance of this difference are explored in terms of the random walk and thermodynamic derivations of the diffusion equation. It is concluded that Fick's Law is the more fundamental and straightforward way to model diffusion processes},
